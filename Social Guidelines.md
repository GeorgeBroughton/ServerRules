# Social Guidelines
These area set of ideals you are expected to follow when speaking with others here. Only gross offences of these, or disrespect of these will result in any permanent action against you, where they are not outlined in the rules section.
### Changes
Community guidelines, rules and policy are subject to change at any time.

## 1. Reflective Listening
Try to use [Reflective Listening techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIATzLf-y04) where possible. Reflective listening is where you listen to the other person and then, you follow up by iterating your understanding of what they said before you move on in the conversation.
This is because saying "I understand" doesn't actually prove to the speaker that you understand what they have said, and this can lead to you construing in your head that whatever they are saying is stupid when in fact you've just missed vital information that you hadn't confirmed with the speaker that you understood.
This probably sounds dumb to anyone reading this, having never tried it before in their lives, however I urge you to give it a try because it works.

## 2. Invalidation
When having conversations, refrain from invalidating each other. Rather, have a discussion surrounding each other's thesis rather than attacking that which isn't yours. The difference is invalidation would involve aggressively picking holes in someone else's beliefs or asserting that your beliefs are factual without putting any effort into your argument. If yours are factual, you should be able to ask a reasonable question that would lead anyone of sound mind to the appropriate conclusion, or you should be able to provide evidence of your thesis.

## 3. Drugs & Alcohol
Use of legal drugs and alcohol while in this community must be kept to a minimum unless the people active in the channel are comfortable with it. See the rules section for illicit substances.
There have been a number of situations in the past where people have used drugs recreationally, and this led to them acting with toxicity.
For example starting arguments due to diminished mental faculties while under the influence.
If you are under the influence and get timed out, this is most likely why you got timed out. When you sober up, we will need to talk.
People may get uncomfortable as consumption progresses beyond a particular point. If this occurs, It's time to ease off it, move to another room, or leave the voice channel. Whichever is more appropriate.
