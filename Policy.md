# Policy
### Changes
Community guidelines, rules and policy are subject to change at any time.

## Friends of Friends
They are welcome. Just bear in mind that I may not be comfortable with your friends joining if you don't know me in some capacity.

## Bots
If you want a music bot, it isn't going to happen anymore.

The problems with it are:
- Most of them locked their volume control behind a paywall, and this resulted in people getting their eardrums ruprtured by a bot being too loud while entering a voice channel. I'm aware individuals have control over the bot volume by right clicking and setting the volume manually, however this disturbs people who are actively working on something that might have to tab out and do that.
- There's also the problem of people trying to play YouTube, Spotify or other sources that use ads. It breaks the Terms of Service of the platform, and the bots either end up being neutered or banned entirely from the API, and this results in us having to constantly cycle out bots to fulfil this. If you want to play videos with people, stream it by streaming a new window of your web browser or something. We also have SyncPlay which is constantly serviced by yours' truly.

## Channel Access
You won't be given permissions to all channels by default.
 - This is to minimise people getting disturbed while actively working on something, and to maintain some level of privacy for specific people on the server if you're a newcomer.
 - If you need permissions to a channel, then ask me.
 - Please just be aware that if you don't do an activity a channel is dedicated for, you likely won't be getting permissions.
 - Also, if you're disturbing people in an activity who need as much silence as possible, you'll be moved to another channel, timed out and your permissions will be removed. Which option I pick will be determined by how persistent you are at doing this.

## Permissions Are Not Rights
- You are given mute and deafen permissions so if someone gets into a conversation with someone in their household, or they've got an excessive amount of noise coming from their mic while they're away from their keyboard and isn't taking part in the discussion, you can ensure that noise isn't disrupting you and others in the channel while you chat by utilising these permissions.
- You are given move permissions so if the conversation splits off into two discrete conversations happening in the same voice channel, you can move the participants into another channel.
- You are given Disconnect permissions so that if someone has been inactive for a prolonged period of time, for example over 1hr, you can disconnect them if you no longer have faith in their return.

If I find you're abusing any privileges you are given here, you will be given the `Limited` permission group for however long I feel is necessary which will override all of your other permissions. You won't be able to do anything other than join voice calls and post messages in channels you have already been given permissions to. In some instances, you may be given Push To Talk (or, PTT) permissions only in voice channels.

## Leaving the Community
Some of you make a point about leaving the community if you get into an argument, or if you fall out with a member despite being friends with more than just the affected individual. If that happens:
- If you leave, you get one chance to rejoin.
  - Your invite link will be delivered approximately 7 days after we receive notice you have left.
  - Notice can be an administrator finding out you are no longer there, should they care to check, or it can be from a direct message to an administrator from yourself or another community member.
  - The invite link will have exactly one use and will be valid for 7 days.
  - Other invite links will not work, as there will be a temporary ban placed against you during this time.
- If you either miss the window for the invite link to work, or you for whatever reason decide to leave again.
  - I will not not spend my time setting your permissions up every time you join, and therefore:
    - You will not be issued a new link.
    - Your ban will become permanent.
    - You will not return.

If you need a break from the people here, make it known to an admin and we may take measures to shadowban the both of you for some predefined amount of time, or you can make efforts to not involve yourself in the community for some time until you feel comfortable with returning. "needing a break" is not an acceptable use of leaving the server. It wastes admin time and doing it excessively could be considered an act of emotional manipulation.

## Bans
Bans will be handled by placing a thread in the info channel and listing out the violations. Everyone will be able to see it. In some cases, you will not be able to respond.  
### Temporary Bans
If a user is temporarily banned, you have the option to dispute it, but only if it was in a text channel.  
If this happened in a voice channel, only the people who were there at the time of the incident will be given permission to dispute anything.  

Anything you do say may be selectively ignored. Reasons for this can include, but are not limited to:
- Suspected manipulation
  - If you bring up information that wasn't available at the time of the offence.
  - If you mention things that don't have any relevence as to whether or not an offence took place.
    - For example: If you mention how they have turned their life around since the ban. Since all you're doing there is making it look like it's in their best interest to not be here.
  - Triangulation
    - This is where a 3rd party relays messages back and forth between someone in this community and the banned user.

### Permanent Bans
If you are to be permanently banned from this community, within 168 hours your account will be unpersoned.

This means every record of your existence will be removed from the community. Be that, where applicable:
- Messages from other people mentioning you.
- Messages, Images, Videos or Links from you.
- Channels, Threads, Emoji or Stickers created by you.
- Events created or attended by you.
- Other members you invited to the community will also be removed unless marked otherwise by an administrator.

Any further mention of your existence will involve message deletion and will be a timeout-able offense.
