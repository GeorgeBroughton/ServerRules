# Rules
This community is a dictatorship, not a democracy. You will be entirely beholden to my personal decisions. If you decide you do not like this, then leave immediately.
Breaching any of these rules will result in a conversation, a timeout, and may result in a permanent ban.

### Changes
Community guidelines, rules and policy are subject to change at any time.

## 0. Reporting
You have a voice. Use it. If you are uncomfortable with people breaking the below rules or social guidelines, then tell them.  
If there are any problems between community members regarding these rules, and they are not respecting your boundaries then send me a direct message, or contact me in a voice channel if I'm online.

## 1. Friendly Fire Will Not Be Tolerated
 - Be respectful toward others.
 - Don't talk over each other.
 - Don't demean people.
 - Don't infantilize people.
 - Don't insult people.
 - Don't construe others as being stupid.
   - This means don't call them stupid, and:
   - Don't phrase your speech in a way that conveys a lack of understanding about another person's speech or actions in joke format. It's rude, and it also shows your own ignorance of the actual underlying mechanisms behind their speech or actions. In short, it shows you don't care about whatever they are discussing, and you should decline the conversation in a more polite manner if that is the case.
 - If you feel the need to do any of the above, [fall back on Reflective Listening techniques.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIATzLf-y04)
 - If people are comfortable with any of the rules in this section being broken, then it may be allowed. However if those same people who were originally comfortable with it, are no longer comfortable with it, stop immediately.

## 2. NSFW Content
Keep Not Safe For Work content in the designated NSFW channels.
 - If it contains nudity of any kind, it goes in NSFW.
 - This includes historical artwork, sculptures and photography.
 - We've got a NSFW memes channel use it for NSFW memes only.
 - Do not post pornography.

## 3. Leaving The Community
- If we find out that you left the community even in part for the purpose of messing with people's emotions, then you aren't worth the effort of setting you back up in this community again. You can go elsewhere and do that instead. This will also be acted upon retroactively. That means if you are found to have done this after we have let you back into the community, you will receive a permanent ban.

## 4. Events
If you have organised an event, and are waiting for people to join in. Similarly, if you haven't arranged anything and want to join in with someone's activity:
- Don't repeatedly join the voice channel to get their attention and ask them about when they're joining.
- Send them a direct message instead.
- If the platform supports this, look at their rich presence, which will show if they are partaking in the activity you wish to join.
  - If they are in the activity, then you may join the call and ask to join them.
  - If they are not, keep it in text channels to avoid bothering people.

I don't mind if you join once to find out when people intend to play a game you have arranged to play that day, the problem arises when you join, ask and leave the chat for the sole purpose of asking this *repeatedly* throughout the day.

## 5. Abuse of Permissions
If I find you're abusing any privileges you are given here out of disrespect for others, you will be given the `Limited` permission group for however long I feel is necessary.
 - This will override all of your other permissions.
 - You won't be able to do anything other than join voice calls and post messages in channels you have already been given permissions to.
 - In some instances, you may be given Push To Talk (or, PTT) permissions only in voice channels.

## 6. Use of Illicit Substances
You're welcome to consume what you like, and even discuss your experiences consuming them, however:
- Do not under any circumstances be under the influence of them while talking to others unless they are comfortable with it.
- Do not encourage others to partake in the consumption of them.

I do not recommend taking them, nor may I be comfortable with you doing so, however I won't stop you.
